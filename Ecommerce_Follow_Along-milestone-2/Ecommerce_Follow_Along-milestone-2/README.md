# Milestone 2: Login Page & Project Structure 🚀  

  
# We concentrated on project structuring, front-end and back-end setup, and creating the e-commerce application's login page in Milestone 2.  



### 📁 Project Organization: The project was arranged using distinct `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.  

### 🌐 Frontend Setup: A React application was started in order to construct the user interface.  
**Tailwind CSS** was set up for utility-based style.  
A properly designed and functional **Login Page** has been implemented.  

### 🛠️ Backend Setup: To get ready for future API integration, set up a simple **Node.js + Express** server.  

### 🎯 Educational Results  
We gained knowledge on how to organize a full-stack project by reaching this milestone.  
Using Tailwind CSS to set up a React application.  
Establishing a backend in Node.js.  
Making a login page with simple design and features.
